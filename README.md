# OOP Visualizer

OOP Visualizer is a Python-based tool designed to help users understand and visualize Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This project provides a visual representation of classes, objects, inheritance, and other OOP principles, making it easier to grasp these fundamental concepts.

## Features

- **Class and Object Visualization**: Visualize classes, objects, and their relationships.
- **Inheritance Visualization**: Display inheritance hierarchies and relationships.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface to interact with OOP concepts.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic visualization with real-time updates.
- **Save and Load**: Save and load visualizations for future reference.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda Distribution (Python 3.6+)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-visualizer.git
    cd oop-visualizer
    ```

2. **Create a Conda Environment**:
    ```bash
    conda create -n oop-visualizer python=3.8
    conda activate oop-visualizer
    ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**:
    ```bash

    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**: Use the interactive interface to visualize various OOP concepts. You can create classes, objects, and see their relationships visually.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with OOP Visualizer:

### Example 1: Visualize a Simple Class
- Create a class `Person` with attributes like `name` and `age`.
- Instantiate objects of the class and visualize them.

### Example 2: Visualize Inheritance
- Create a base class `Animal` and derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat`.
- Visualize the inheritance hierarchy.
